# ASP.NET Core with angular on Raspberry Pi 3
Example aspnetcore project in combination with angular the can be published to a raspberry pi

# Introduction
When I bought my first rapsberry pi I was right in the middle of my first angular training and orienting myself in the wonderous world of domotica. Initially my idea was to create a personal domotica dashboard (with some controls) with the use of ASP.NET Core and Angular and host it on my raspberry pi. Unfortunatly that wasn't as easy as it sounded to me and did not work as with setting up the project and publish it with arm runtime support. Stubborn as I can be I wanted to get this thing working and started googling. 

This resulted in this repository, where I wanted to share my findings (as I'm blogless) and provide a simple how-to for how to get your first ASP.Net Core with Angular app working on a raspberry pi 3.
